The Journey:

 It was a challenging task for my team as this is our first project and also we had to clone the website within a week, we had never built a project with such extensive collaboration, it was like we were the Product Manager and the developers as well. With this great team, planning, and teamwork continued during Zoom meetings. Each of us handled different tasks to ensure the successful submission of our work.
Project Details:
 We are given a task to make a functional clone website of an e-commerce company ToyMarche. Toymarche is an Indian startup that sells all kinds of toys and offers people from across India to sell their products on the platform itself. Both buyers and sellers can use the website for their needs. The website has lots of functionality such as login, signup, homepage, add to cart, add to wishlist, delete from cart, delete from the wishlist, coupon code, purchase, address book, payment verified with OTP, and the order success, etc.
We tried our best to clone the website from scratch based on the knowledge gained from unit 2 at Masai School. We have imparted the majority of functions that the Toymarche website has. We used Git hub to collaborate, HTML for page structures, CSS for styling, and Javascript for functionality.
